## Description
Minor Excel process automation. Place all your PID files in the `/data` directory. Delete them after processing. 

## Notes
1. **Ensure that you make copies of all files before running program.** I am NOT liable for any consequences if you fail to do so. This program will overwrite files. That is how it works. By using this program, you accept the risk of data loss.
2. You are encouraged to make modifications to the code. You are also encouraged to learn some programming. LLMs are not yet able to perform most programming tasks independently. If you want programming work, the optimal approach is to lead the work and let the model assist you, rather than letting it lead and you direct.

## TODO - Feel free to implement these yourself
- [ ] Delete PID files after processing
- [ ] Implement Option 2
